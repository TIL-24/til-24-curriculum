    "### Why Model Efficiency Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of AI, efficiency is not just about speed; it's about making AI accessible and practical for everyday applications. The size and complexity of deep learning models have grown tremendously. While this leads to improved performance, it creates challenges for deployment, especially on mobile devices, embedded systems, or any setting where computational resources or power are limited. Model efficiency techniques aim to address these challenges without sacrificing accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing model complexity poses challenges:\n",
    "- Storage: Large models consume more storage space.\n",
    "- Inference Speed: Complex models take longer to process inputs.\n",
    "- Energy Consumption: Computationally demanding models drain batteries quickly.\n",
    "- Deployment: Resource-constrained devices (smartphones, IoT) struggle with large models."
