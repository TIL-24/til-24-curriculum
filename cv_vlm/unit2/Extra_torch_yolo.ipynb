    "\n",
    "For applications requiring YOLO implementations within a PyTorch environment, the Ultralytics organization provides a pre-trained (upto) YOLOv5 model readily accessible through the PyTorch Hub: https://pytorch.org/hub/ultralytics_yolov5/. This resource offers a convenient starting point for leveraging YOLOv5 functionalities.\n",

    "## Version Availability:\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that subsequent YOLO versions (beyond v5) developed by Ultralytics are not currently open-sourced. This implies that the specific model architectures and pre-trained weights associated with these later versions are not publicly available for unrestricted use or modification."
